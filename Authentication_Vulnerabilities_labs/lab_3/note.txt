Vulnerable - Username enumeration using its response times

Goals:
1- Enumerate a valid username
2- Brute-force this user's password
3- Access the account page of this user

Given information:
Username: wiener
Password: peter

Analysis:
--------

after login with wrong username or password many time this message comes up
-> You have made too many incorrect login attempts. Please try again in 30 minute(s).

IP-based brute-force

-> username 1 -> Add X-Forwarded-For: 1 to the request
-> response -> Invalid username or password.

-> username 2 -> Add X-Forwarded-For: 1 to the request
-> response -> You have made too many incorrect login attempts. Please try again in 30 minute(s).

-> username 2 -> Add X-Forwarded-For: 2 to the request
-> response -> Invalid username or password.

For each username a number
username 1 -> X-Forwarded-For: 1
username 2 -> X-Forwarded-For: 2
note: if used the intruder and set the numbers from 1 to 100
the next time you need to set the numbers from 101 to 201, you can't use the same number twice.

All usernames and password(a 100 time)-> response time -> between 200 and 500
For example: username: user and password: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
note: when using the intruder you need to set the password like this.

username: adkit -> response time -> 1400

username adkit and password chelsea -> 302 response

Username: adkit
Password: chelsea
