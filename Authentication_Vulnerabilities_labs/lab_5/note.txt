Vulnerable - Logic flaw

Goals:
1- Enumerate a valid username
2- Brute-force this user
3- Access the account page of this user

Analysis:
--------

try to login with the username (atlas) 4-5 times 
-> 200 response -> You have made too many incorrect login attempts. Please try again in 1 minute(s).

-> other usernames -> Invalid username or password

username atlas and password mom 
-> 200 response and length 3158 -> between all the other requests there was only one request that has length 3158
-> all the other requests say Invalid user or wait for 1 minute

note: Try passwords.txt first if it didn't word try newpass.txt.

Username: atlas
Password: mom
