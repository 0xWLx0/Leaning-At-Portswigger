first login :
wiener: peter

access admin panle
you get this masseage -> Admin interface only available to local users 

intercept the request and send it to the repeater
change the http method to **TRACE**

you will notice **X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 2.88.104.3** in the response

use this header in the get request and set it to 127.0.0.1

GET /admin HTTP/2
Host: 0aa4005a04a8a3ca81eb2ba2008f00f5.web-security-academy.net
